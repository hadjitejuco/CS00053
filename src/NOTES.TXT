Arraylist

VS

Traditional Array


1.  Size of data 
    
    Traditional Array

    Fixed size
        int[] arr = new int[10];

    ArrayList

    Dynamic
        size grow - shrink (operations adding, delete)
    
    ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();

2. Data type that it can hold

    Traditional Array 
        int[] intArray = new int[5];
        String[] stringArray = new String[5];

    ArrayList
        Wrapped the data type

        ArrayList<Integer> intList = new ArrayList<>();
        ArrayList<String> stringList = new ArrayList<>();

3.  Flexibility and Methods

    Traditional Array
        - does not provide built in methods 
            add, removing

    ArrayList
        methods 
                .add()
                .remove()
                .size()
                .contain()
